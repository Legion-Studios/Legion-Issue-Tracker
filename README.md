## FAQ
| Question  | Short Answer | Long Answer
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Is Legion going to do walkers or walking animations for mechs of any kind?  | Not any time soon (if ever) for Arma 3, for Reforger/Arma 4, definitely  | For Arma 3, while incredibly immersive, the techniques required are also tedious and time-intensive for a developer to learn and pick up. We've got other development priorities and don't really have the resources or inclination to recommend to one of our developers to attempt to learn the process at this current time. With Reforger/Arma 4, custom bones are supported natively and doesn't require us to break the engine to attempt to make it work. |
| Can you give [insert vehicle here] handling/feature/weaponry like [insert vanilla vehicle]?  | We can certainly look into it! Please include the classname of what vanilla assets you're referencing when you make a suggestion  | N/a  |
| Will Legion be making an active HUD system like OPTRE?  | We're planning on doing a barebones minimalist HUD system for Arma 3. Reforger is TBD.  | N/a  |


# Process
When searching for new content to suggest...

## Already Suggested Content
If something is already on a development sheet, **PLEASE DO NOT RESUGGEST IT**, however, you can suggest that something be moved up in priority, be changed to have a different balance, or be moved from a "POTENTIAL" sheet into the development queue.

## Increasing Priority of a feature/asset
If you are suggesting moving an asset from one of the "POTENTIAL" sheets to a development queue or vice versa, please provide your reasoning as to *why* it's necessary for the priority to be changed.
